# Contact Sheet Generator

Simple ruby script to generate contact sheets of one or more folders with JPG and/or PNG files.

# Notes

* PDF currently only accepts JPG and PNG files.
* Use the ThumbGenerator script to generate thumbnails first, since the full images are being embedded in the PDF file (=> very large file).

Usage:
ruby ContactSheet.rb [-b] image_folder [image_folder2]
